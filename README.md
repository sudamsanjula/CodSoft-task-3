The provided code is a Python script designed to facilitate the exploration of a movie dataset by allowing users to search for the top 5 highest-rated films based on specified criteria—genre, director, or actor. It begins by importing the pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis. The script features a function, get_dataset_path(), which prompts the user to input the file path of the dataset. This function attempts to read the dataset using pd.read_csv(), handling common errors such as file not found or encoding issues through a series of exceptions, ensuring that the user receives informative messages for troubleshooting.
Once the dataset is successfully loaded, the script moves to the core functionality with the list_top_films() function. This function takes the DataFrame, filter type, and filter value as arguments. Depending on the user's selection—either genre, director, or actor—it filters the DataFrame to include only relevant entries, utilizing string matching for flexibility. The filtered DataFrame is then sorted by the film ratings in descending order, and the top 5 entries are selected. If no films match the criteria, the user is informed accordingly.
The script execution is initiated in the if __name__ == "__main__": block, where it welcomes the user and prompts them to specify the search criteria. After gathering the necessary input, the script invokes the list_top_films() function to display the desired results. Overall, this structured approach provides a user-friendly interface for exploring movie data, focusing on high-rated films based on user-defined parameters, and enhancing data accessibility and analysis.
**
The Output**
The output begins with a welcoming message, indicating that the user has successfully initiated the Movie Rating Prediction Project. Following this, the user is prompted to provide the path to their dataset file. In this instance, the user inputs the path to the "IMDb-Movies-India.csv" file, located on their desktop. The script successfully reads the dataset, confirming this with the message that the dataset was loaded successfully from the specified path. This step is crucial as it establishes the foundation for the subsequent data analysis.
After loading the dataset, the script asks the user to specify the type of search they wish to conduct, offering the options of genre, director, or actor. The user selects "genre" and is then prompted to enter a specific genre to search for—in this case, "action." The script proceeds to filter the dataset based on this input, identifying films that fall under the action genre.
The output then presents the top 5 highest-rated films in the action genre, along with relevant details for each film. Each row displays several columns, including the film's name, release year, genre, rating, director, and lead actors. The highest-rated film listed is "I'm in Love," released in 2007, with a remarkable rating of 9.2, followed closely by "Dus" from 1997, rated at 9.1. Other notable entries include "Kaadan," which blends action with drama and fantasy, and features a notable rating of 9.1. The remaining films also display high ratings, showcasing the effectiveness of the script in identifying and ranking films based on user-defined criteria. Overall, this output effectively illustrates the functionality of the script, demonstrating its ability to filter and present relevant information based on user input.
